Export single posts or select a list of posts and generate an export for the wordpress standard importer

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to export any wordpress post type by checking a box and clicking export. It allows you to be more specific with the posts to be exported than the regular wordpress exporter allows. 

You are then able to import posts using the standard wordpress importer mechanism.
